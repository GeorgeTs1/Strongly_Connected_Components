# Strongly_Connected_Components
Strongly Connected Components C++ CEID Project


This Algorithm finds storngly connected components in directed graphs similar to LEDA algorithm(STRONG_COMPONENTS)

Î¤he experimental evaluation of this algorithm has been tested to random directed graphs with at max 500K vertices and 800K edges
